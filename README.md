# ColorGen

Generates and displays:

1) a single color and its hex code via color picker
2) a gradient and its hex codes via dual color picker
3) a random color palette and associated rgb codes by clicking a button

Some potential upgrades to consider:

A complete redesign to the UI, especially the gradient generator and palette picker 
Be able to display hex codes, as well as simply showing redesigned color swatches for palette picker 
Being able to switch between rgb, hex, and hsl codes, as well as color names showing tertiary colors, shades, tones, etc.
